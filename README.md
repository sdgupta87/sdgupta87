# About me

Postdoctoral researcher | University of Oregon

Skills: Synthetic Biology | Protein-Protein Interactions | Gene Editing

In my PhD: I was investigating the RNA-protein assemblies governing the protein translocation in thermophilic archaea and actively collaborating with cross-functional groups to carry out purification of challenging proteins, biophysical characterization of protein and DNA binding phenomena. This research sharpened my skills in fluorescence spectroscopic measurements of various protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, along with recombinant protein expression and purification. 

In my postdoc: I moved to the University of Oregon to integrate their engineering principles with my fundamental research in protein function and create a translational output. Here, I am developing a multiplexed antigen-antibody interaction platform that leverages scalable gene synthesis, library-on-library screening, and in vivo protein-protein interaction assays. This strategy aims to identify high-specificity binders with sequence validation and broad proteome coverage in half the cost and time than it currently requires.
